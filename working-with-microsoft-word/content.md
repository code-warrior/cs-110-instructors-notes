Cookies

¹∕₂ cup softened vegan butter
¹∕₂ cup coconut sugar or organic cane sugar
3 Tbsp aquafaba (liquid from a can of chickpeas, not whipped) or pumpkin purée
1 Tsp vanilla extract
³∕₄ Tsp baking powder
¹∕₄ Tsp cream of tartar (optional adds tanginess — if you don’t have, omit)
1 ¹∕₄ Tsp ground cinnamon
¹∕₄ Tsp sea salt
1 ¹∕₃ cup gluten-free flour blend
1 ¹∕₄ cup almond flour (not almond meal)
2 Tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot starch (cornstarch yields slightly fluffier texture)

Instructions

Preheat oven to 350℉ (176℃) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
Prepare the coating for later by adding coconut sugar or organic cane sugar and cinnamon to a small bowl and mixing to combine. Set aside.
Add softened butter of choice to a large mixing bowl and beat until creamy and smooth — about 1 minute.
Add sugar of choice and mix on medium speed until fluffy and light — about 1 minute. Then add chickpea brine (aquafaba, or other egg substitute) and vanilla and mix again, scraping down sides as needed.
Add baking powder, cream of tartar (optional), ground cinnamon, and sea salt, and blend to combine. Then add gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and cornstarch or arrowroot and stir with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are combined.
The dough should be thick and almost difficult to mix at this point. If too soft, add 1 Tbsp gluten-free flour blend and almond flour at a time until a thick, mold-able dough is formed. Then cover and transfer dough to the refrigerator.
Use a cookie scooper (like this one) or tablespoon to measure out 1 ¹∕₂ Tbsp amounts of dough to gently roll into balls. The dough will still be soft, so be gentle. Roll in the cinnamon-sugar topping and arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheets. Press down gently with the palm of your hand or a glass to smash slightly.
Bake for 10 – 12 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and expanded. Remove from the oven and let cool on a baking sheet for 10 minutes. Then enjoy!
Once cooled, store leftover cookies covered at room temperature for 3 – 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.
